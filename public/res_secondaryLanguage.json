They establish a new way to interact with technology through our thinking, since these interfaces allow us to transform it into real actions in our environment. It has 3 principles which are: Signal Acquisition, Signal Processing and Application. There are various applications in the medical field such as controlling movement in a wheelchair or a wireless robot in this project were used to control an upper limb orthosis.",
